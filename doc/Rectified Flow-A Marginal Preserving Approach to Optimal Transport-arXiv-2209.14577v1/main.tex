\begin{abstract}
We present a flow-based approach to 
the optimal transport (OT) problem 
between two continuous distributions $\tg_0,\tg_1$ on $\RR^d$,
of minimizing a transport cost $\E[c(X_1-X_0)]$ 
in the set of couplings $(X_0,X_1)$ whose marginal distributions on $X_0,X_1$ equals $\tg_0,\tg_1$, respectively, 
where $c$ is a cost function.
Our method iteratively constructs a sequence of neural ordinary differentiable equations (ODE),  
each learned by solving a simple unconstrained regression problem, which 
monotonically reduce the transport cost while automatically preserving the marginal constraints. 
This yields a monotonic 
\emph{interior} approach that traverses inside the set of valid couplings to decrease the transport cost, 
which distinguishes itself from most existing approaches that enforce the coupling constraints from the outside. 
The main idea of the method draws from 
\emph{rectified flow} \cite{rectified}, 
a recent approach 
that simultaneously decreases 
the whole family of  
transport costs induced by convex functions $c$
(and is hence \emph{multi-objective} in nature), 
but is not tailored to minimize a  specific transport cost. 
Our method is a \emph{single-object} variant of rectified flow 
that guarantees to solve the OT problem 
for a fixed, user-specified convex cost function $c$.
